Interactive Animation of Relative Motion of Planets in Solar System

This repository contains interactive animation of relative motion of planets in our solar system. My purpose behind creation of this project was to get some familiarity with JavaScript and create simple yet intuitive example of programming abstraction.
Although there is not much of astrophysics to learn here ;) there is great deal of Mathematics, Programming and Modeling to learn in the making of this project.

Simulation is hosted at: https://l-ashwin.github.io/Project-Solis/

Note. 
Sizes and distances from sun, for planets are in proportion to actual, also the angular speeds.
Planet sizes are not to scale with inter planet distances also size of sun and orbit of moon are not the scale, which seemed required for better visualization.
